        <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: bold;">Education is the most powerful means of personal development and social
             development. In a general statement, we can say, “Education is the acquisition
              of knowledge or skills on something special or special.” However, when it is widely
               identified, education is a systematic and lifelong process. Again, the formal education
                we are accustomed to is a form of the narrow concept of education. This article tries to 
                discuss  the origin of the words education and education , the definition of education,
                 the concept of education and the goals and objectives of education.</p>
